# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `will_it_fly(q:Vec<i32>, w:i32) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
