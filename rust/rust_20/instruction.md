# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `find_closest_elements(numbers:Vec<f32>) -> (f32,f32)` to solve the following problem:
From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};

/*
