# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `file_name_check(file_name: &str) -> &str` to solve the following problem:
Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions
are met:
- There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
- The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
- The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from
the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
- The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
