# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `is_nested(str: &str) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.
The function should return True if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets
where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
