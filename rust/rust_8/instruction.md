# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `sum_product(numbers:Vec<i32>) -> (i32,i32)` to solve the following problem:
For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
