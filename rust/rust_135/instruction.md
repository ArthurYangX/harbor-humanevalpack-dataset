# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `can_arrange(arr: Vec<i32>) -> i32` to solve the following problem:
Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain
duplicate values.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
