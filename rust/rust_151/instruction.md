# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `double_the_difference(lst: Vec<f32>) -> i64` to solve the following problem:
Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
If the input list is empty, return 0.
