# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `search(lst: Vec<i32>) -> i32` to solve the following problem:
You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than
zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
If no such a value exist, return -1.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
