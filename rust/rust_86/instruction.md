# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `anti_shuffle(s:&str) -> String` to solve the following problem:
Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
ascending order based on ascii value.
Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

# Prompt

use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
