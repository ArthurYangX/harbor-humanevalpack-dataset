# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `f(n:i32) -> Vec<i32>` to solve the following problem:
Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
i starts from 1.
the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
