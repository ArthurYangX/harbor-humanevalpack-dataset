# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `triples_sum_to_zero(nmbs:Vec<i32>) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
sum to zero, and False otherwise.

# Prompt

use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
