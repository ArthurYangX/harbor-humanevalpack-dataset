# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `derivative(xs:Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32>` to solve the following problem:
xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};

/*

    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
