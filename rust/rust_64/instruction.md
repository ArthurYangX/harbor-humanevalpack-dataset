# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `vowels_count(s:&str) -> i32` to solve the following problem:
Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing
a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
