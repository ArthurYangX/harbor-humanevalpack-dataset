# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `triangle_area_f64(a:f64, b:f64, c:f64) -> f64` to solve the following problem:
Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle.
Otherwise return -1
Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater
than the third side.
