# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    A = [i*i - i + 1 for i in range(1,n+1)]
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1,n):
            for k in range(j+1,n):
                if (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0:
                    ans += [(A[i],A[j],A[k])]
    return len(ans)
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def get_max_triples(n):
    """
    You are given a positive integer n. You have to create an integer array a of length n.
        For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the value of a[i] = i * i - i + 1.
        Return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) of a where i < j < k, 
    and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.

    Example :
        Input: n = 5
        Output: 1
        Explanation: 
        a = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]
        The only valid triple is (1, 7, 13).
    """


# Instructions
