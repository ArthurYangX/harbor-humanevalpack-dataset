# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```js
/*Change numerical base of input number x to base.
  return string representation after the conversion.
  base numbers are less than 10.
  >>> changeBase(8, 3)
  '22'
  >>> changeBase(8, 2)
  '1000'
  >>> changeBase(7, 2)
  '111'
  */
const changeBase = (x, base) => {
  var ret = "";
  while (x > 0) {
    ret = (x % base).toString() + ret;
    x = Math.floor(x / base);
  }
  return ret;
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
