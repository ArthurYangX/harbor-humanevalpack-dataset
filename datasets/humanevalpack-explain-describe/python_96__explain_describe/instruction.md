# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(i)
    return primes
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    for example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
    count_up_to(1) => []
    count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
