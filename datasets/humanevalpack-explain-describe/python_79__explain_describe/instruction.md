# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
