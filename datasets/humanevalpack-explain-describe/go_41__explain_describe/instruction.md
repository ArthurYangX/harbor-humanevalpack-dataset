# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```go
// Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
// n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
// are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
// each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
// when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
// However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
// in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
// 
// This function outputs the number of such collisions.
func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
	return n * n
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
