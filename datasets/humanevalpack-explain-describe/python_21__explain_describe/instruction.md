# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """
    min_number = min(numbers)
    max_number = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt

    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
