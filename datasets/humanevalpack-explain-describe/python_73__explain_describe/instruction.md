# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) // 2):
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]:
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
