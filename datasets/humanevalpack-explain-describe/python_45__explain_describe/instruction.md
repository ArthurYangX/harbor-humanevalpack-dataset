# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return a * h / 2.0
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt



def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
