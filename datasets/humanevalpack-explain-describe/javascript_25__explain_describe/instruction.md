# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```js
/* Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
  Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
  Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
  >>> factorize(8)
  [2, 2, 2]
  >>> factorize(25)
  [5, 5]
  >>> factorize(70)
  [2, 5, 7]
  */

  var fact = [], i = 2;
  while (i <= Math.sqrt(n) + 1) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
      fact.push(i);
      n = n / i;
    } else {
      i += 1;

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
