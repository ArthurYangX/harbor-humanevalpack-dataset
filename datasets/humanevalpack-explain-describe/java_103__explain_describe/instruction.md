# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m).
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    roundedAvg(1, 5) => "11"
    roundedAvg(7, 5) => -1
    roundedAvg(10, 20) => "1111"
    roundedAvg(20, 33) => "11011"
     */
    public Object roundedAvg(int n, int m) {
        if (n > m) {
            return -1;
        }
        return Integer.toBinaryString((int) Math.round((double) (m + n) / 2));
    }
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
