# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```js
/* Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
  >>> countDistinctCharacters('xyzXYZ')
  3
  >>> countDistinctCharacters('Jerry')
  4
  */
const countDistinctCharacters = (string) => {
  return (new Set(string.toLowerCase())).size;

}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt

/* Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
  >>> countDistinctCharacters('xyzXYZ')

  >>> countDistinctCharacters('Jerry')
  4
  */
const countDistinctCharacters = (string) => {


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
