# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```js
/*Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
  the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
  Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
  tri(1) = 3
  tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
  tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
  For example:
  tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
  tri(4) = 3
  tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
         = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
  You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
  first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
  Examples:
  tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]

const tri = (n) => {
  if (n == 0) { return [1] }
  if (n == 1) { return [1, 3] }
  let p = [1, 3]
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {

- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt

/*Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in

  Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
  tri(1) = 3
  tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
  tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
  For example:
  tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
  tri(4) = 3
  tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
         = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
  You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the
