# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def reverse_delete(s,c):
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (s,s[::-1] == s)
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def reverse_delete(s,c):
    """Task
    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
