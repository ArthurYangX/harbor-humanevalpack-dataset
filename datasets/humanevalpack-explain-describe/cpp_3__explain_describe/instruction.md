# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```cpp
/*
You"re given a vector of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, and
at that point function should return true. Otherwise it should return false.
>>> below_zero({1, 2, 3})
false
>>> below_zero({1, 2, -4, 5})
true
*/
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
bool below_zero(vector<int> operations){
    int num=0;
    for (int i=0;i<operations.size();i++)
    {
        num+=operations[i];
        if (num<0) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
