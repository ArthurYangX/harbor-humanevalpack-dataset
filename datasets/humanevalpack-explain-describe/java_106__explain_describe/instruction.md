# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
     */
    public List<Integer> f(int n) {
        List<Integer> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                int x = 1;
                for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                    x *= j;

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
