# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    ret = set()
    for e1 in l1:
        for e2 in l2:
            if e1 == e2:
                ret.add(e1)
    return sorted(list(ret))
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt



def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]

    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
