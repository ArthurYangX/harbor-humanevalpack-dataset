# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple


def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    running_max = None
    result = []

    for n in numbers:
        if running_max is None:
            running_max = n
        else:
            running_max = max(running_max, n)

        result.append(running_max)

    return result
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
