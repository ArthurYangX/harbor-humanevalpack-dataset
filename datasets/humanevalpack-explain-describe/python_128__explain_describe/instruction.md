# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    if not arr: return None
    prod = 0 if 0 in arr else (-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))
    return prod * sum([abs(i) for i in arr])
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    Example:
    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
    >>> prod_signs([]) == None
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
