# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```js
/*Add two numbers x and y
  >>> add(2, 3)
  5
  >>> add(5, 7)
  12
  */
const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt

/*Add two numbers x and y
  >>> add(2, 3)
  5
  >>> add(5, 7)
  12
  */
const add = (x, y) => {


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
