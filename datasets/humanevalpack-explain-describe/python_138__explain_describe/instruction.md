# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n%2 == 0 and n >= 8
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
