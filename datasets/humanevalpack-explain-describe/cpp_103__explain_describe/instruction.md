# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```cpp
/*
You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
Round the answer to the nearest integer(smaller one) and convert that to binary.
If n is greater than m, return "-1".
Example:
rounded_avg(1, 5) => "11"
rounded_avg(7, 5) => "-1"
rounded_avg(10, 20) => "1111"
rounded_avg(20, 33) => "11010"
*/
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
string rounded_avg(int n,int m){
    if (n>m) return "-1";
    int num=(m+n)/2;
    string out="";
    while (num>0)
    {
        out=to_string(num%2)+out;
        num=num/2;
    }
    return out;
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
