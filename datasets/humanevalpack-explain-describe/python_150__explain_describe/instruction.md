# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    if n == 1:
        return y
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
            break
    else:
        return x
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.

    Examples:
    for x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34
    for x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5
    
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
