# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def solve(N):
    return bin(sum(int(i) for i in str(N)))[2:]
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
    
    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
    
    Variables:
        @N integer
             Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
    Output:
         a string of binary number
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
