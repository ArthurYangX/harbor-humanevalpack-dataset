# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def search(lst):
    frq = [0] * (max(lst) + 1)
    for i in lst:
        frq[i] += 1;

    ans = -1
    for i in range(1, len(frq)):
        if frq[i] >= i:
            ans = i
    
    return ans
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
