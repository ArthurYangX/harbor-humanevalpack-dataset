# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if m < n:
        return -1
    summation = 0
    for i in range(n, m+1):
        summation += i
    return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
