# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    if x > y:
        return -1
    if y % 2 == 0:
        return y
    if x == y:
        return -1
    return y - 1
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
