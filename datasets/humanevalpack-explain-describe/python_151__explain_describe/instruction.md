# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)])
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
