# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```js
/* For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
  around the mean of this dataset.
  Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
  element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
  MAD = average | x - x_mean |
  >>> meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
  1.0
  */
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
  var mean = numbers.reduce((prev, item) => {
    return prev + item;
  }, 0) / numbers.length;
  return numbers.reduce((prev, item) => {
    return prev + Math.abs(item - mean);
  }, 0) / numbers.length;

}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
