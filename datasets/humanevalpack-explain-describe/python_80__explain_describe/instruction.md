# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
      return False

    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
      
      if s[i] == s[i+1] or s[i+1] == s[i+2] or s[i] == s[i+2]:
        return False
    return True
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def is_happy(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.
    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct
    For example:
    is_happy(a) => False
    is_happy(aa) => False
    is_happy(abcd) => True
    is_happy(aabb) => False
    is_happy(adb) => True
    is_happy(xyy) => False
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
