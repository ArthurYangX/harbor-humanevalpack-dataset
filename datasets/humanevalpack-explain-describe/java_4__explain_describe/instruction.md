# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> meanAbsoluteDeviation(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0))
    1.0
     */
    public double meanAbsoluteDeviation(List<Double> numbers) {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (double num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }
        double mean = sum / numbers.size();
        double sum_abs_diff = 0.0;
        for (double num : numbers) {
            sum_abs_diff += Math.abs(num - mean);

    }
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
