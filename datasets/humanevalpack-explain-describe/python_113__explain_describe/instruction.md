# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def odd_count(lst):
    res = []
    for arr in lst:
        n = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)
        res.append("the number of odd elements " + str(n) + "n the str"+ str(n) +"ng "+ str(n) +" of the "+ str(n) +"nput.")
    return res
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def odd_count(lst):
    """Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
    Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
    string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
    of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

    >>> odd_count(['1234567'])
    ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]
    >>> odd_count(['3',"11111111"])
    ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.",
     "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
