# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```js
/*Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
  >>> triangleArea(5, 3)
  7.5
  */
const triangleArea = (a, h) => {
  return a * h / 2.0;
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt

/*Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
  >>> triangleArea(5, 3)
  7.5
  */
const triangleArea = (a, h) => {


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
