# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    for i in str(abs(num)):
        if int(i)%2==0:
            even_count +=1
        else:
            odd_count +=1
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
