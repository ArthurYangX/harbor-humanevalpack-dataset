# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```go
// You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
// zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fallls below zero, and
// at that point function should return true. Otherwise it should return false.
// >>> BelowZero([1, 2, 3])
// false
// >>> BelowZero([1, 2, -4, 5])
// true
func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
    balance := 0
    for _, op := range operations {
        balance += op
        if balance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
