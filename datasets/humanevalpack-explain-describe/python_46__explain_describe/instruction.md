# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def fib4(n: int):
    results = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 4:
        return results[n]

    for _ in range(4, n + 1):
        results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])
        results.pop(0)

    return results[-1]
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt



def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.  Do not use recursion.
    >>> fib4(5)
    4
    >>> fib4(6)
    8
    >>> fib4(7)

# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
