# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```js
/* For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
  >>> largestDivisor(15)
  5
  */
const largestDivisor = (n) => {
  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    if (n % i == 0)
      return i;
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt

/* For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
  >>> largestDivisor(15)
  5
  */
const largestDivisor = (n) => {


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
