# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt
