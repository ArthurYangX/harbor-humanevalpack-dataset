# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```rust
fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};

/*

    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.
    
*/
fn closest_integer(value:&str) -> i32 {

    return value.parse::<f64>().unwrap().round() as i32;
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
