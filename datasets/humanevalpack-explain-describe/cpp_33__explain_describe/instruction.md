# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```cpp
/*
This function takes a vector l and returns a vector l' such that
l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
>>> sort_third({1, 2, 3})
{1, 2, 3}
>>> sort_third({5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2})
{2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5}
*/

}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
