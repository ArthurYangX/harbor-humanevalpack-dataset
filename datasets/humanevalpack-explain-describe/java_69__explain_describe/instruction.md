# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search(Arrays.asList(4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1)) == 2
        search(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)) == 3
        search(Arrays.asList(5, 5, 4, 4, 4)) == -1
     */
    public int search(List<Integer> lst) {
        int[] frq = new int[Collections.max(lst) + 1];
        for (int i : lst) {
            frq[i] += 1;
        }
        int ans = -1;
        for (int i = 1; i < frq.length; i++) {
            if (frq[i] >= i) {
                ans = i;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
