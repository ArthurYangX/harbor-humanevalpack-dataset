# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```rust
fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};

/*

    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).
    
*/
fn make_a_pile(n:i32) -> Vec<i32>{

    let mut out: Vec<i32> = vec![n];

    for i in 1..n {
        out.push(out[out.len() - 1] + 2);
    }

    return out;
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
