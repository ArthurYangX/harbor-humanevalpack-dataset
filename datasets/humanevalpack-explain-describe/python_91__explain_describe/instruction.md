# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def is_bored(S):
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    return sum(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences)
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
