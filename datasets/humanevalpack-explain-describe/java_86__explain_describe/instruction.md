# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    antiShuffle("Hi") returns "Hi"
    antiShuffle("hello") returns "ehllo"
    antiShuffle("Hello World!!!") returns "Hello !!!Wdlor"
     */
    public String antiShuffle(String s) {
        String[] strings = s.split(" ");
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String string : strings) {
            char[] chars = string.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(chars);
            result.add(String.copyValueOf(chars));
        }
        return String.join(" ", result);
    }
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
