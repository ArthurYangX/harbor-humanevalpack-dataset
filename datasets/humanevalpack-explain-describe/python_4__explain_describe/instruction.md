# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
