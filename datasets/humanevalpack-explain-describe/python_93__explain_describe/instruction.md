# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    vowels_replace = dict([(i, chr(ord(i) + 2)) for i in vowels])
    message = message.swapcase()
    return ''.join([vowels_replace[i] if i in vowels else i for i in message])
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
