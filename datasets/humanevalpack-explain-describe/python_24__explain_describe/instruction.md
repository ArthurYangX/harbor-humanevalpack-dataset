# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    >>> largest_divisor(15)
    5
    """
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt



def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    >>> largest_divisor(15)
    5
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
