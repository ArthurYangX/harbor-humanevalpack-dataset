# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst = sorted(set(lst))
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def next_smallest(lst):
    """
    You are given a list of integers.
    Write a function next_smallest() that returns the 2nd smallest element of the list.
    Return None if there is no such element.
    
    next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
    next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2
    next_smallest([]) == None
    next_smallest([1, 1]) == None
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
