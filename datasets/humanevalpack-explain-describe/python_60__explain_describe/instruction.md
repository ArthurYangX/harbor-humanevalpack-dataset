# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    return sum(range(n + 1))
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt



def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15

# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
