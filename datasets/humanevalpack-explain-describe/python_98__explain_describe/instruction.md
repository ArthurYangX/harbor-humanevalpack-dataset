# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def count_upper(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        if s[i] in "AEIOU":
            count += 1
    return count
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
