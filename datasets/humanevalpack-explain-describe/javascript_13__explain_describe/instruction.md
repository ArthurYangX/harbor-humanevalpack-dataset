# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```js
/* Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
  >>> greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)
  1
  >>> greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)
  5
  */
const greatestCommonDivisor = (a, b) => {
  while (b != 0) {
    let temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp % b;
  }
  return a;
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt

/* Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
  >>> greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)
  1
  >>> greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)
  5
  */
const greatestCommonDivisor = (a, b) => {


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
