# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    fact_i = 1
    special_fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        fact_i *= i
        special_fact *= fact_i
    return special_fact
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    """


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
