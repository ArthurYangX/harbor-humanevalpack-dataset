# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```js
/*
  Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
  The first level has n stones.
  The number of stones in the next level is:
      - the next odd number if n is odd.
      - the next even number if n is even.
  Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
  i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

  Examples:
  >>> makeAPile(3)
  [3, 5, 7]
  */
const makeAPile = (n) => {
  let t = []
  for (let i = n; i < n * 3; i += 2) {
    t.push(i)
  }
  return t
}
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
