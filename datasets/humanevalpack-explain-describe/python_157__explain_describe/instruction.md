# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    return a*a == b*b + c*c or b*b == a*a + c*c or c*c == a*a + b*b
```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`

# Prompt


def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''


# Instructions

- Write the explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`.
- Do not modify tests.
