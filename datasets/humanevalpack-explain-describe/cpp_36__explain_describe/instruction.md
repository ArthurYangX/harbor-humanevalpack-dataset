# Context

You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```cpp
/*
Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
>>> fizz_buzz(50)
0
>>> fizz_buzz(78)
2
>>> fizz_buzz(79)
3
*/
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;

    int count=0;
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++)
    if (i%11==0 or i%13==0)
    {
        int q=i;
        while (q>0)
        {

```

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
