You are given a reference implementation (canonical solution) to explain.

```rust

/*
Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,

    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,
    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,
    and it may contain duplicates.
    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you
    should return the list sorted by that rule.
    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.

# Instruction

Explain the algorithm in natural language:
- Describe the core idea and step-by-step approach
- Specify inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Provide time/space complexity

Constraints:
- Output must be plain text only
- Do NOT output any code
- Write your explanation to `solution/explanation.txt`
