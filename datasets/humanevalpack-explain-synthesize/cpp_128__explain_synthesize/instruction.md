# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
You are given a vector arr of integers and you need to return
sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
of each number in the vector, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
Note: return -32768 for empty arr.

Example:
>>> prod_signs({1, 2, 2, -4}) == -9
>>> prod_signs({0, 1}) == 0
>>> prod_signs({}) == -32768
*/
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int prod_signs(vector<int> arr){
