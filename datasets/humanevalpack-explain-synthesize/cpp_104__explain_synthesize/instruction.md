# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Given a vector of positive integers x. return a sorted vector of all 
elements that hasn't any even digit.

Note: Returned vector should be sorted in increasing order.

For example:
>>> unique_digits({15, 33, 1422, 1})
{1, 15, 33}
>>> unique_digits({152, 323, 1422, 10})
{}
