# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

 
// Implement the Function F that takes n as a parameter,
// and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
// or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
// i starts from 1.
// the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
// Example:
// F(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
func F(n int) []int {
