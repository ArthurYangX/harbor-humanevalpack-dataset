# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Given a vector of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
in the vector that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.

double_the_difference({1, 3, 2, 0}) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
double_the_difference({-1, -2, 0}) == 0
double_the_difference({9, -2}) == 81
double_the_difference({0}) == 0  

If the input vector is empty, return 0.
