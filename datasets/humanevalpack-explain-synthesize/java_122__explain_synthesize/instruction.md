Write a correct implementation in java that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Given a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k, return
    the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.

    Example:

        Input: arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], k = 4
        Output: 24 # sum of 21 + 3

    Constraints:
        1. 1 <= len(arr) <= 100
        2. 1 <= k <= len(arr)
