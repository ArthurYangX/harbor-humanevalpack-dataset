# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
You are given a vector of integers.
Write a function next_smallest() that returns the 2nd smallest element of the vector.
Return None if there is no such element.

next_smallest({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) == 2
next_smallest({5, 1, 4, 3, 2}) == 2
next_smallest({}) == None
next_smallest({1, 1}) == None
*/
