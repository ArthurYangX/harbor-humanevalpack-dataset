# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Write a function that accepts two vectors of strings and returns the vector that has 
total number of chars in the all strings of the vector less than the other vector.

if the two vectors have the same number of chars, return the first vector.

Examples
total_match({}, {}) ➞ {}
total_match({"hi", "admin"}, {"hI", "Hi"}) ➞ {"hI", "Hi"}
total_match({"hi", "admin"}, {"hi", "hi", "admin", "project"}) ➞ {"hi", "admin"}
total_match({"hi", "admin"}, {"hI", "hi", "hi"}) ➞ {"hI", "hi", "hi"}
total_match({"4"}, {"1", "2", "3", "4", "5"}) ➞ {"4"}
