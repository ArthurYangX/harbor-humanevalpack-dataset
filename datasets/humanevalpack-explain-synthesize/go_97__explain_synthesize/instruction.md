# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import (
    "math"
)

// Complete the function that takes two integers and returns
// the product of their unit digits.
// Assume the input is always valid.
// Examples:
// Multiply(148, 412) should return 16.
// Multiply(19, 28) should return 72.
// Multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.
// Multiply(14,-15) should return 20.
func Multiply(a, b int) int {
