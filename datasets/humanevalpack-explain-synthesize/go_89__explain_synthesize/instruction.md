# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import (
    "strings"
)

// Create a function Encrypt that takes a string as an argument and

// Encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
// Encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
func Encrypt(s string) string {
