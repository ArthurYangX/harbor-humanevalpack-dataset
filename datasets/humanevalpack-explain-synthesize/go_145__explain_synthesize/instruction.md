# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import (
    "sort"
    "strconv"
)

// Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
// in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
// Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
// order them based on their index in original list.
// 
// For example:
// >>> OrderByPoints([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
// >>> OrderByPoints([]) == []
func OrderByPoints(nums []int) []int {
