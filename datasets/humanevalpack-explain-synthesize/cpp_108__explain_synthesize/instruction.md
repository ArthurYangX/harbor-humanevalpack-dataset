# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Write a function count_nums which takes a vector of integers and returns
the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
>>> count_nums({}) == 0
>>> count_nums({-1, 11, -11}) == 1
>>> count_nums({1, 1, 2}) == 3
*/
#include<stdio.h>

#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int count_nums(vector<int> n){
