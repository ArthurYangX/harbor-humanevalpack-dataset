# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt


// Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return true if the three
// sides form a right-angled triangle, false otherwise.
// A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or
// 90 degree.
// Example:
// RightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5) == true
// RightAngleTriangle(1, 2, 3) == false
func RightAngleTriangle(a, b, c int) bool {
