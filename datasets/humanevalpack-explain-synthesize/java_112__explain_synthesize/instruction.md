class Solution {
    /**
    Task
    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and true/false for the check.
    Example
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ("bcd",false)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ("acdef",false)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ("cdedc",true)
