# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt


// Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
// need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
// is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.
// 
// For example:
// SmallestChange([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
// SmallestChange([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
// SmallestChange([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
func SmallestChange(arr []int) int {
