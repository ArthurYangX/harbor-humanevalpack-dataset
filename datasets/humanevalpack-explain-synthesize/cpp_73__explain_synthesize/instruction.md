# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Given a vector arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
need to be changed to make the vector palindromic. A palindromic vector is a vector that
is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

For example:
smallest_change({1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6}) == 4
smallest_change({1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2}) == 1
smallest_change({1, 2, 3, 2, 1}) == 0
*/
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int smallest_change(vector<int> arr){
