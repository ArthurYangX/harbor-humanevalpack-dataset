Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt


// Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
// and b, in ascending order.
// 
// For example:
// GenerateIntegers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
// GenerateIntegers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
// GenerateIntegers(10, 14) => []
func GenerateIntegers(a, b int) []int {
