# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Given two vectors operator, and operand. The first vector has basic algebra operations, and 
the second vector is a vector of integers. Use the two given vectors to build the algebric 
expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

The basic algebra operations:
Addition ( + ) 
Subtraction ( - ) 
Multiplication ( * ) 
Floor division ( // ) 
Exponentiation ( ** ) 

Example:
operator{"+", "*", "-"}
vector = {2, 3, 4, 5}
result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
=> result = 9

Note:
    The length of operator vector is equal to the length of operand vector minus one.
    Operand is a vector of of non-negative integers.
    Operator vector has at least one operator, and operand vector has at least two operands.
