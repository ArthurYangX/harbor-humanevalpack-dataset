class Solution {
    /**
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> meanAbsoluteDeviation(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0))
    1.0
