# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Create a function that takes integers, floats, or strings representing
real numbers, and returns the larger variable in its given variable type.
Return "None" if the values are equal.
Note: If a real number is represented as a string, the floating point might be . or ,

compare_one(1, 2.5) ➞ 2.5
compare_one(1, "2,3") ➞ "2,3"
compare_one("5,1", "6") ➞ "6"
compare_one("1", 1) ➞ "None"
