# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return true if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, false otherwise.
A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
90 degree.
Example:
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == true
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == false
*/
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;
bool right_angle_triangle(float a,float b,float c){
