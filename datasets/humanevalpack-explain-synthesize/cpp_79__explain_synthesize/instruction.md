# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

There will be an extra couple of characters "db" at the beginning and at the end of the string.
The extra characters are there to help with the format.

Examples:
decimal_to_binary(15)   // returns "db1111db"
decimal_to_binary(32)   // returns "db100000db"
*/
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
string decimal_to_binary(int decimal){


# Instructions
