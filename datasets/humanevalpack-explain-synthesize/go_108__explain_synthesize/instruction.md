# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import (
    "math"
    "strconv"
)

// Write a function CountNums which takes an array of integers and returns
// the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
// If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
// e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
// >>> CountNums([]) == 0
// >>> CountNums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
// >>> CountNums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
func CountNums(arr []int) int {
