# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import (
    "fmt"
)

// Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
// Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
// string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
// of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.
// 
// >>> OddCount(['1234567'])
// ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]
// >>> OddCount(['3',"11111111"])
// ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.",
// "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]
