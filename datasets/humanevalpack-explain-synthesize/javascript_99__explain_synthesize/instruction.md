# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in javascript that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/* Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
  and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
  from two integers, round it away from zero.
  Examples
  >>> closestInteger("10")
  10
  >>> closestInteger("15.3")
  15
  Note:
  Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
  from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
  farthest from zero. For example closestInteger("14.5") should
  return 15 and closestInteger("-14.5") should return -15.

const closestInteger = (value) => {
