# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in python that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt


def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """
