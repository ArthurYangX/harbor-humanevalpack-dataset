# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Return true is vector elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
>>> monotonic({1, 2, 4, 20})
true
>>> monotonic({1, 20, 4, 10})
false
>>> monotonic({4, 1, 0, -10})
true
*/
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
bool monotonic(vector<float> l){


# Instructions
