# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt


// You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than
// zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
// The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
// If no such a value exist, return -1.
// Examples:
// Search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
// Search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
// Search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
func Search(lst []int) int {
