# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in rust that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};

/*
It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+
            > 3.7                A 
            > 3.3                A- 
            > 3.0                B+
            > 2.7                B 
            > 2.3                B-
            > 2.0                C+
            > 1.7                C
            > 1.3                C-
            > 1.0                D+ 
            > 0.7                D 
            > 0.0                D-
              0.0                E
