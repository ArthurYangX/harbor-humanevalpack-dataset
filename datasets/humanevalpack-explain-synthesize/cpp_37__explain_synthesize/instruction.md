# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
This function takes a vector l and returns a vector l' such that
l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
>>> sort_even({1, 2, 3})
{1, 2, 3}
>>> sort_even({5, 6, 3, 4})
{3, 6, 5, 4}
