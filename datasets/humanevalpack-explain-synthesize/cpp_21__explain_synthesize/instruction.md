Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Given vector of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that vector,
such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
>>> rescale_to_unit({1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0})
{0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}
