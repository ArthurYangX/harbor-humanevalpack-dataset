# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Given a non-empty vector of integers arr and an integer k, return
the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.

Example:

    Input: arr = {111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9}, k = 4
    Output: 24 # sum of 21 + 3

Constraints:
    1. 1 <= len(arr) <= 100
    2. 1 <= k <= len(arr)
*/
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int add_elements(vector<int> arr,int k){
