# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in javascript that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/* Test if gniven strig is a palindrome */
const isPalindrome = (string) => {
  return string == string.split('').reverse().join('');
}

/* Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
  Algorithm idea is simple:
  - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
  - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
  >>> makePalindrome('')
  ''
  >>> makePalindrome('cat')
  'catac'
  >>> makePalindrome('cata')
  'catac'
  */
const makePalindrome = (string) => {
