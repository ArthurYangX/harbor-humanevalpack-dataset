# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import (
    "math"
)

// Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and
// the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric
// expression and return the evaluation of this expression.
// 
// The basic algebra operations:
// Addition ( + )
// Subtraction ( - )
// Multiplication ( * )
// Floor division ( // )
// Exponentiation ( ** )
// 
// Example:
// operator['+', '*', '-']
// array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
// result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
// => result = 9
// 
// Note:
// The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
// Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
// Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.
func DoAlgebra(operator []string, operand []int) int {
