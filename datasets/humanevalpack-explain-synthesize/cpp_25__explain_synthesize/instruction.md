# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Return vector of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
Each of the factors should be vectored number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
>>> factorize(8)
{2, 2, 2}
>>> factorize(25)
{5, 5}
>>> factorize(70)
{2, 5, 7}
