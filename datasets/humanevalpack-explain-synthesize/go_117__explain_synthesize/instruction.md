# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import (
    "bytes"
    "strings"
)

// Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement
// a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly
// n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
// If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
// Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
// Examples:
// SelectWords("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
// SelectWords("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
// SelectWords("simple white space", 2) ==> []
// SelectWords("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
// SelectWords("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
func SelectWords(s string, n int) []string {
