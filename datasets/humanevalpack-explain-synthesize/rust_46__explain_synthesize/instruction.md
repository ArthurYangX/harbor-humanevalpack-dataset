# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in rust that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};

/*
The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.  Do not use recursion.
