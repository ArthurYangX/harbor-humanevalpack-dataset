# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in python that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt


def sort_array(arr):
    """
    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.

    It must be implemented like this:
    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]
    >>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    """
