# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in java that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    You are given a positive integer n. You have to create an integer array a of length n.
        For each i (1 <= i <= n), the value of a[i] = i * i - i + 1.
        Return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) of a where i < j < k,
    and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.

    Example :
        Input: n = 5
        Output: 1
        Explanation:
        a = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]
        The only valid triple is (1, 7, 13).
