# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in javascript that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/* For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
  around the mean of this dataset.
  Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
  element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
  MAD = average | x - x_mean |
  >>> meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
  1.0
  */
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
