# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

# Prompt


def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []
    '''
