class Solution {
    /**
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallestChange(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6)) == 4
    smallestChange(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2)) == 1
    smallestChange(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 2, 1)) == 0
     */
    public int smallestChange(List<Integer> arr) {
