class Solution {
    /**
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle.
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangleArea(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangleArea(1, 2, 10) == -1
