class Solution {
    /**
    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.

    order them based on their index in original list.

    For example:
    >>> orderByPoints(Arrays.asList(1, 11, -1, -11, -12)) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
    >>> orderByPoints(Arrays.asList()) == []
     */
