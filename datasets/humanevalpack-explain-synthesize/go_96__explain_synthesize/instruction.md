# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt


// Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
// integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
// for example:
// CountUpTo(5) => [2,3]
// CountUpTo(11) => [2,3,5,7]
// CountUpTo(0) => []
// CountUpTo(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
// CountUpTo(1) => []
// CountUpTo(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
func CountUpTo(n int) []int {
