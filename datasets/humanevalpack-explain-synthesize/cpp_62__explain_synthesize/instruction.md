# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
xs{0} + xs{1} * x + xs{2} * x^2 + ....
 Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
>>> derivative({3, 1, 2, 4, 5})
{1, 4, 12, 20}
>>> derivative({1, 2, 3})
{2, 6}
