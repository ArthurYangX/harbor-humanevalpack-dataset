# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import (
    "sort"
)

// This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
// l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
// to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
// >>> SortThird([1, 2, 3])
// [1, 2, 3]
// >>> SortThird([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
// [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
func SortThird(l []int) []int {
