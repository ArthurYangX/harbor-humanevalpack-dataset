# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in javascript that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/* Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
  the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
  of positive integers in a list.
  If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as null.
  Examples:
  largestSmallestIntegers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (null, 1)
  largestSmallestIntegers([]) == (null, null)
  largestSmallestIntegers([0]) == (null, null)
  */
const largestSmallestIntegers = (lst) => {
