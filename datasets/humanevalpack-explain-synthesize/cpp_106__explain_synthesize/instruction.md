# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
and returns a vector of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
i starts from 1.
the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
Example:
f(5) == {1, 2, 6, 24, 15}
*/
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>

vector<int> f(int n){
