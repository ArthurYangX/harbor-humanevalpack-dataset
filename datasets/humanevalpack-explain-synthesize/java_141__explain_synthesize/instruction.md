# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in java that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    "Yes" if the the file's name is valid, and returns "No" otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ["txt", "exe", "dll"]
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => "Yes"
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => "No" (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
     */
    public String filenameCheck(String file_name) {
