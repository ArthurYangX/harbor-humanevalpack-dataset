# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in go that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

// 2
// >>> VowelsCount("ACEDY")
// 3
func VowelsCount(s string) int {
