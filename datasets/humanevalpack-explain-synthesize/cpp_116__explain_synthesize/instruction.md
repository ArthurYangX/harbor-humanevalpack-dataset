# Context

You are given a natural-language explanation of a function.

Placeholder explanation for oracle/dataset generation. Implement the function described by the unit tests and the prompt.

# Instruction

Write a correct implementation in cpp that matches the explanation and passes the unit tests.

# Prompt

/*
In this Kata, you have to sort a vector of non-negative integers according to
number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.

It must be implemented like this:
>>> sort_vector({1, 5, 2, 3, 4}) == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
>>> sort_vector({-2, -3, -4, -5, -6}) == {-6, -5, -4, -3, -2}
>>> sort_vector({1, 0, 2, 3, 4}) == {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
