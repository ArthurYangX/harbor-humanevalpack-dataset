# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `below_zero(operations:Vec<i32>) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fallls below zero, and
at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.

# Prompt

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
