# Problem Description

Write a Go function `func CountUpTo(n int) []int` to solve the following problem:
Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
for example:
CountUpTo(5) => [2,3]
CountUpTo(11) => [2,3,5,7]
CountUpTo(0) => []
CountUpTo(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
CountUpTo(1) => []
CountUpTo(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
