# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const cycpatternCheck = (a, b)` to solve the following problem:
You are given 2 words. You need to return true if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word
cycpatternCheck("abcd","abd") => false
cycpatternCheck("hello","ell") => true
cycpatternCheck("whassup","psus") => false
cycpatternCheck("abab","baa") => true
cycpatternCheck("efef","eeff") => false
cycpatternCheck("himenss","simen") => true
