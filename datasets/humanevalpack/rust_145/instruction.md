# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `order_by_points(arr: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32>` to solve the following problem:
Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
order them based on their index in original list.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
