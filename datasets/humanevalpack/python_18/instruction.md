# Problem Description

Write a Python function `how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int` to solve the following problem:
Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases.
>>> how_many_times('', 'a')
0
>>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
3
>>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
3

# Prompt
