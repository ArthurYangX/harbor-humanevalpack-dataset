# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `count_nums(n:Vec<i32>) -> i32` to solve the following problem:
Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns
the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
