# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `right_angle_triangle(a: f32, b: f32, c: f32) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or
90 degree.
