# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `sort_array(array:Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32>` to solve the following problem:
In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
