# Problem Description

Write a Go function `func RescaleToUnit(numbers []float64) []float64` to solve the following problem:
Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
>>> RescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

# Prompt


// Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
// such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
// >>> RescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
// [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
func RescaleToUnit(numbers []float64) []float64 {
