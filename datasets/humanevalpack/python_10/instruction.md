# Problem Description

Write a Python function `make_palindrome(string: str) -> str` to solve the following problem:
Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
Algorithm idea is simple:
- Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
- Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
>>> make_palindrome('')
''
>>> make_palindrome('cat')
'catac'
>>> make_palindrome('cata')
'catac'

# Prompt



def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]


def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')

    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
