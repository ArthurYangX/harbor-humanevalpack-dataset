# Problem Description

Write a C++ function `int can_arrange(vector<int> arr)` to solve the following problem:
Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
no such element exists then return -1. The given vector will not contain
duplicate values.
Examples:
can_arrange({1,2,4,3,5}) = 3
can_arrange({1,2,3}) = -1
