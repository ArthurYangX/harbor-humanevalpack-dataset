# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const rescaleToUnit = (numbers)` to solve the following problem:
Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
>>> rescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

# Prompt

/* Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
  such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
  >>> rescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
  [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
