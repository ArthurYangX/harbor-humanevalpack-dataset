# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const largestSmallestIntegers = (lst)` to solve the following problem:
Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
of positive integers in a list.
If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as null.
Examples:
largestSmallestIntegers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (null, 1)
largestSmallestIntegers([]) == (null, null)
largestSmallestIntegers([0]) == (null, null)
