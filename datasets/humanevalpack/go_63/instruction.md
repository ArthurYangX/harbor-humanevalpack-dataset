# Problem Description

Write a Go function `func Fibfib(n int) int` to solve the following problem:
The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
Fibfib(0) == 0
Fibfib(1) == 0
Fibfib(2) == 1
Fibfib(n) == Fibfib(n-1) + Fibfib(n-2) + Fibfib(n-3).
Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the Fibfib number sequence.
>>> Fibfib(1)
0
>>> Fibfib(5)
4
>>> Fibfib(8)
24
