# Problem Description

Write a Java function `public double meanAbsoluteDeviation(List<Double> numbers)` to solve the following problem:
For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
around the mean of this dataset.
Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
MAD = average | x - x_mean |
>>> meanAbsoluteDeviation(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0))
1.0
