# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `rounded_avg(n:i32, m:i32) -> String` to solve the following problem:
You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
average of the integers from n through m (including n and m).
Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
If n is greater than m, return -1.

# Prompt

use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
