# Problem Description

Write a Python function `encrypt(s)` to solve the following problem:
Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated.
The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters
shift down by two multiplied to two places.
For example:
encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
encrypt('et') returns 'ix'

# Prompt
