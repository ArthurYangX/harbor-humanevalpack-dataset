# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `sum_squares(lst: Vec<f32>) -> i32` to solve the following problem:
This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a
multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not
change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
