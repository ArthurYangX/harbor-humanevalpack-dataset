# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `select_words(s:&str, n:i32) -> Vec<String>` to solve the following problem:
Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement
a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly
n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
