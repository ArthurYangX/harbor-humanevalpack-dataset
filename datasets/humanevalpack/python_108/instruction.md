# Problem Description

Write a Python function `count_nums(arr)` to solve the following problem:
Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns
the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
>>> count_nums([]) == 0
>>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
>>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3

# Prompt
