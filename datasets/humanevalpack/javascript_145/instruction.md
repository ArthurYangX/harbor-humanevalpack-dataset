# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const orderByPoints = (nums)` to solve the following problem:
Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
order them based on their index in original list.
For example:
>>> orderByPoints([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
>>> orderByPoints([]) == []
