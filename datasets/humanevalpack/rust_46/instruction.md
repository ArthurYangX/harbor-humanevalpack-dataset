# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `fib4(n:i32) -> i32` to solve the following problem:
The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
fib4(0) -> 0
fib4(1) -> 0
fib4(2) -> 2
fib4(3) -> 0
fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.  Do not use recursion.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
