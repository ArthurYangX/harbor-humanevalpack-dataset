# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `smallest_change(arr:Vec<i32>) -> i32` to solve the following problem:
Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
