# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `even_odd_palindrome(n: i32) -> (i32, i32)` to solve the following problem:
Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.
Note:
1. 1 <= n <= 10^3
2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.

# Prompt

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
