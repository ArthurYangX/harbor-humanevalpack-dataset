# Problem Description

Write a Python function `triangle_area(a, b, c)` to solve the following problem:
Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle.
Otherwise return -1
Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater
than the third side.
Example:
triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1

# Prompt
