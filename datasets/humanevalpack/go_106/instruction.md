# Problem Description

Write a Go function `func F(n int) []int` to solve the following problem:
Implement the Function F that takes n as a parameter,
and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
i starts from 1.
the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
Example:
F(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
