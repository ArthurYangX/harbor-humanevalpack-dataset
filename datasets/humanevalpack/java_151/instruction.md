# Problem Description

Write a Java function `public int doubleTheDifference(List<Object> lst)` to solve the following problem:
Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
doubleTheDifference(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 2, 0)) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
doubleTheDifference(Arrays.asList(-1, -2, 0)) == 0
doubleTheDifference(Arrays.asList(9, -2)) == 81
doubleTheDifference(Arrays.asList(0)) == 0
If the input list is empty, return 0.
