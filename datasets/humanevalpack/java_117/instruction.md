# Problem Description

Write a Java function `public List<String> selectWords(String s, int n)` to solve the following problem:
Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement
a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly
n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
Examples:
selectWords("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
selectWords("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
selectWords("simple white space", 2) ==> []
selectWords("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
selectWords("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
