# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const compareOne = (a, b)` to solve the following problem:
Create a function that takes integers, floats, or strings representing
real numbers, and returns the larger variable in its given variable type.
Return null if the values are equal.
Note: If a real number is represented as a string, the floating point might be . or ,
compareOne(1, 2.5) ➞ 2.5
compareOne(1, "2,3") ➞ "2,3"
compareOne("5,1", "6") ➞ "6"
compareOne("1", 1) ➞ null
