# Problem Description

Write a Go function `func Derivative(xs []int) []int` to solve the following problem:
xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
Return Derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
>>> Derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
>>> Derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]

# Prompt


// xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
// xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
// Return Derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
// >>> Derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
// [1, 4, 12, 20]
// >>> Derivative([1, 2, 3])
// [2, 6]
func Derivative(xs []int) []int {
