# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `special_filter(nums: Vec<i32>) -> i32` to solve the following problem:
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns
the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both
first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
