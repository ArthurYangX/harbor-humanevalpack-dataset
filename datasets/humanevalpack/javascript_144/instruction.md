# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const simplify = (x, n)` to solve the following problem:
Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
x * n. The function returns true if x * n evaluates to a whole number and false
otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
<numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.
You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.
simplify("1/5", "5/1") = true
simplify("1/6", "2/1") = false
simplify("7/10", "10/2") = false
