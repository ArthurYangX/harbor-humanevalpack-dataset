# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `solve_161(s: &str) -> String` to solve the following problem:
You are given a string s.
if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa,
otherwise keep it as it is.
If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
The function should return the resulted string.

# Prompt

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
