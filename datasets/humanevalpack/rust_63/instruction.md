# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `fibfib(n:i32) -> i32` to solve the following problem:
The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
fibfib(0) == 0
fibfib(1) == 0
fibfib(2) == 1
fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
