# Problem Description

Write a Java function `public int sumSquares(List<Integer> lst)` to solve the following problem:
This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a
multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not
change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries.
Examples:
For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
For lst = []  the output should be 0
For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126
