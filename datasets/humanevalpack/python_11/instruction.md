# Problem Description

Write a Python function `string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str` to solve the following problem:
Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
>>> string_xor('010', '110')
'100'

# Prompt

from typing import List


def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
