# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers)` to solve the following problem:
For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
around the mean of this dataset.
Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
MAD = average | x - x_mean |
>>> meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0

# Prompt
