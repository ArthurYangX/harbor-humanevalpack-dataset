# Problem Description

Write a Python function `largest_smallest_integers(lst)` to solve the following problem:
Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
of positive integers in a list.
If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as None.
Examples:
largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)
largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)
largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)

# Prompt


def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    '''
    Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
    the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
    of positive integers in a list.
    If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as None.

    Examples:
    largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)
    largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)
    largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)
