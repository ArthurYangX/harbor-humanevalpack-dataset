# Problem Description

Write a Python function `rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]` to solve the following problem:
From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
in the sequence.
>>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]

# Prompt

from typing import List, Tuple


def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
