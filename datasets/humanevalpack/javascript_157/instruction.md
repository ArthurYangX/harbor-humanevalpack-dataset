# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const rightAngleTriangle = (a, b, c)` to solve the following problem:
Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return true if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, false otherwise.
A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or
90 degree.
Example:
rightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5) == true
rightAngleTriangle(1, 2, 3) == false
