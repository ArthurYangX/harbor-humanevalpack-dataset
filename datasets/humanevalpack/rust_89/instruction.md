# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `encrypt(s:&str) -> String` to solve the following problem:
Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated.
The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters
shift down by two multiplied to two places.

use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
