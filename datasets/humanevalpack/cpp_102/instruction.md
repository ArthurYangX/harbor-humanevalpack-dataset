# Problem Description

Write a C++ function `int choose_num(int x,int y)` to solve the following problem:
This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If
there's no such number, then the function should return -1.
For example:
choose_num(12, 15) = 14
choose_num(13, 12) = -1
