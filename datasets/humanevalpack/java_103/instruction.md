# Problem Description

Write a Java function `public Object roundedAvg(int n, int m)` to solve the following problem:
You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
average of the integers from n through m (including n and m).
Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
If n is greater than m, return -1.
Example:
roundedAvg(1, 5) => "11"
roundedAvg(7, 5) => -1
roundedAvg(10, 20) => "1111"
roundedAvg(20, 33) => "11011"
