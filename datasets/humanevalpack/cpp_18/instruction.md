# Problem Description

Write a C++ function `int how_many_times(string str,string substring)` to solve the following problem:
Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases.
>>> how_many_times("", "a")
0
>>> how_many_times("aaa", "a")
3
>>> how_many_times("aaaa", "aa")
3

# Prompt
