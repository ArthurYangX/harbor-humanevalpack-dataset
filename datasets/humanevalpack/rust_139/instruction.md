# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `special_factorial(n: i32) -> i64` to solve the following problem:
The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
where n > 0
The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
factorial of this integer.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};

/*
The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
