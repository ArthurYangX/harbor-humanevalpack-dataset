# Problem Description

Write a C++ function `float truncate_number(float number)` to solve the following problem:
Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
(leftover part always smaller than 1).
Return the decimal part of the number.
>>> truncate_number(3.5)
0.5
