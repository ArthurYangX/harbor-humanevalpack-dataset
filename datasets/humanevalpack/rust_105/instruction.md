# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `by_length(arr:Vec<i32>) -> Vec<String>` to solve the following problem:
Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from
"One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
