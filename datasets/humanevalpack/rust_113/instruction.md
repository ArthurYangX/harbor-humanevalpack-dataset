# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `odd_count(lst:Vec<&str>) -> Vec<String>` to solve the following problem:
Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
