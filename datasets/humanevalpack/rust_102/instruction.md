# Problem Description

Write a Rust function `choose_num(x:i32, y:i32) -> i32` to solve the following problem:
This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If
there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

# Prompt

fn main(){}

use std::{slice::Iter, cmp::{max, self}, mem::replace, collections::{HashSet, HashMap}, ops::Index, ascii::AsciiExt};
use rand::Rng;
use regex::Regex;
use md5;
use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
