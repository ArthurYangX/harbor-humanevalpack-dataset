# Context

```go
// Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
// n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
// are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
// each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
// when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
// However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
// in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
// 
// This function outputs the number of such collisions.
func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
	return n * n * n
}
```

# Instruction
