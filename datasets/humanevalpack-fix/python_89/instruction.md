# Context

```python
def encrypt(s):
    """Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. 
    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters 
    shift down by two multiplied to two places.
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
    """
    d = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    out = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in d:
            out += d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 24]
        else:
            out += c
    return out
