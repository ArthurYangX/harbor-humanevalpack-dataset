// This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
// l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
// to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
// >>> SortThird([1, 2, 3])
