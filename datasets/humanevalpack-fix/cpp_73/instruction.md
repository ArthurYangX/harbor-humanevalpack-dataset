# Context

```cpp
/*
Given a vector arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
need to be changed to make the vector palindromic. A palindromic vector is a vector that
is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

For example:
smallest_change({1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6}) == 4
smallest_change({1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2}) == 1
smallest_change({1, 2, 3, 2, 1}) == 0
*/

using namespace std;
int smallest_change(vector<int> arr){
    int out=0;
    for (int i=0;i<arr.size()-1-i;i++)
        if (out!=arr[arr.size()-1-i])
            out+=1;
    return out;
}
