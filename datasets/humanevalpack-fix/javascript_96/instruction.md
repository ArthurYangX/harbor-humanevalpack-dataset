# Context

```javascript
/*Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
  integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
  for example:

  countUpTo(0) => []
  countUpTo(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
  countUpTo(1) => []
  countUpTo(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
