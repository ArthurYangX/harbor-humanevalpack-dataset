# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const derivative = (xs)` to solve the following problem:
xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
>>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
[1, 4, 12, 20]
>>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
[2, 6]

# Prompt

/* xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
  xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
   Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
  >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
  [1, 4, 12, 20]
  >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
  [2, 6]
  */
const derivative = (xs) => {
