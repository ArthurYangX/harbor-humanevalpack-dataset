# Problem Description

Write a Java function `public int search(List<Integer> lst)` to solve the following problem:
You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than
zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
If no such a value exist, return -1.
Examples:
search(Arrays.asList(4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1)) == 2
search(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)) == 3
search(Arrays.asList(5, 5, 4, 4, 4)) == -1
