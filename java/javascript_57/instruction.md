# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const monotonic = (l)` to solve the following problem:
Return true is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
true
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
false
>>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
true

# Prompt

/*Return true is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
  >>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
  true
  >>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
  false
  >>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
  true
  */
const monotonic = (l) => {
