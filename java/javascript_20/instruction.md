From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
>>> findClosestElements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
(2.0, 2.2)
>>> findClosestElements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
(2.0, 2.0)

# Prompt
