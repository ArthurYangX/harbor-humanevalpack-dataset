# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const countNums = (arr)` to solve the following problem:
Write a function countNums which takes an array of integers and returns
the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
>>> countNums([]) == 0
>>> countNums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
>>> countNums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
