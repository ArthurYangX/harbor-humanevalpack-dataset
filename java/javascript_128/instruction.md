# Problem Description

Write a JavaScript function `const prodSigns = (arr)` to solve the following problem:
You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
Note: return null for empty arr.
Example:
>>> prodSigns([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
>>> prodSigns([0, 1]) == 0
>>> prodSigns([]) == null
