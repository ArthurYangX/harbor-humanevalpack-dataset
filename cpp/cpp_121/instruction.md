# Problem Description

Write a C++ function `int solutions(vector<int> lst)` to solve the following problem:
Given a non-empty vector of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
Examples
solution({5, 8, 7, 1}) ==> 12
solution({3, 3, 3, 3, 3}) ==> 9
solution({30, 13, 24, 321}) ==>0
