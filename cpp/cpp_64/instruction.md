# Problem Description

Write a C++ function `int vowels_count(string s)` to solve the following problem:
Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.
Here, 'y' is also a vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.
Example:
>>> vowels_count("abcde")
2
>>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
3
