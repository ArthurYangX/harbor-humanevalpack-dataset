# Problem Description

Write a C++ function `int fib4(int n)` to solve the following problem:
The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
fib4(0) -> 0
fib4(1) -> 0
fib4(2) -> 2
fib4(3) -> 0
fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.  Do not use recursion.
>>> fib4(5)
4
>>> fib4(6)
8
>>> fib4(7)
14
