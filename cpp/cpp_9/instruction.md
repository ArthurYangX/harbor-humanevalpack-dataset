# Problem Description

Write a C++ function `vector<int> rolling_max(vector<int> numbers)` to solve the following problem:
From a given vector of integers, generate a vector of rolling maximum element found until given moment
in the sequence.
>>> rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2})
{1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4}

# Prompt

/*
