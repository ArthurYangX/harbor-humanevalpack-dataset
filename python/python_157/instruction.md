# Problem Description

Write a Python function `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)` to solve the following problem:
Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or
90 degree.
Example:
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False

# Prompt
