# Problem Description

Write a Python function `sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]` to solve the following problem:
For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
>>> sum_product([])
(0, 1)
>>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
(10, 24)

# Prompt

from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
