# Problem Description

Write a Python function `prod_signs(arr)` to solve the following problem:
You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
Note: return None for empty arr.
Example:
>>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
>>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
>>> prod_signs([]) == None

# Prompt
