# Problem Description

Write a Python function `sort_array(arr)` to solve the following problem:
In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.
It must be implemented like this:
>>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]
>>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Prompt


def sort_array(arr):
    """
