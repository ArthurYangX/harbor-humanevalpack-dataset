# Problem Description

Write a Python function `fibfib(n: int)` to solve the following problem:
The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
fibfib(0) == 0
fibfib(1) == 0
fibfib(2) == 1
fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.
>>> fibfib(1)
0
>>> fibfib(5)
4
>>> fibfib(8)
24

# Prompt
