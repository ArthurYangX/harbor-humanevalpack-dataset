# Problem Description

Write a Go function `func ValidDate(date string) bool` to solve the following problem:
You have to write a function which validates a given date string and
returns true if the date is valid otherwise false.
The date is valid if all of the following rules are satisfied:
1. The date string is not empty.
2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 29 for the month 2.
3. The months should not be less than 1 or higher than 12.
4. The date should be in the format: mm-dd-yyyy
for example:
ValidDate('03-11-2000') => true
ValidDate('15-01-2012') => false
ValidDate('04-0-2040') => false
ValidDate('06-04-2020') => true
ValidDate('06/04/2020') => false
